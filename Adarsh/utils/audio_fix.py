"""Fixes the "video plays, no sound" symptom for files whose audio track is a codec no browser
decodes natively (AC3, E-AC3/Dolby Digital Plus, DTS, TrueHD — all common in MKV rips, all
licensed codecs no browser ships a decoder for, in WebCodecs or otherwise).

The server stays a byte passthrough for every other file. Only when a file's chosen audio track
is one of these codecs does this module step in, and even then it only re-encodes the audio
(cheap: a few hundred kb/s of audio, not the video) while the video stream is copied untouched
(`-c:v copy`) — real transcoding is never applied to video.

ffmpeg/ffprobe read the file through the server's own existing streaming endpoint (loopback),
reusing all of its existing Range/auth handling rather than duplicating it. That self-call carries
a marker header (see INTERNAL_HEADER) so the route handler knows to skip this module entirely for
it — otherwise probing or transcoding a file would recursively probe/transcode itself.

    start_seconds seeks the *input* before decoding anything (`-ss` before `-i`: fast, and the
    only option that makes sense with `-c:v copy` anyway, since there's no re-encode to seek
    within — it lands on the nearest preceding keyframe, which is normal/expected for stream-copy
    seeking). This is how seeking works with no disk cache: a seek just starts a fresh transcode
    from the new point rather than resuming an existing one.

    Mixing a copied stream (keeps whatever timestamps the source has, exactly, since it's never
    decoded) with a re-encoded one (gets brand-new, perfectly regular timestamps from the AAC
    encoder) is a well-known ffmpeg source of audio/video drift — and if the source itself has
    any timing irregularity (common in real-world rips, far more than in a clean synthetic test
    file), that drift compounds continuously through playback, not just once at a seek point.
    `aresample=async=1:min_hard_comp=0.100000:first_pts=0` (the full form of the fix, not just
    the bare filter) lets the audio resampler continuously stretch/compress to stay locked to
    actual video timing rather than drifting. `-avoid_negative_ts make_zero` keeps a seek from
    handing either stream a negative/offset starting timestamp relative to the other.
    `-frag_duration` bounds how long a fragment can run even without a video keyframe, so audio
    and video stay closely interleaved in the output instead of one trailing the other by however
    long the source's keyframe interval happens to be.
